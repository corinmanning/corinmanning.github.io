                    <h2 class="section-heading">Why does your ACL tear?</h2>
                    
                    <p>The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is located in the middle of the knee joint. This ligament connects the femur (thigh bone) to the tibia (shin bone) 
                    and is located underneath the patella (knee cap), deep inside the joint. It does most of the work of holding the upper and lower legs together. The reason 
                    the ACL is so vulnerable to tearing is that it is forced to endure much more strain than it is really designed for. The problem comes in when we try to make 
                    sudden shifts in the weight strain on our knees. When we stop suddenly while running, or when we make a sharp turn at high speed, our knees must bear the 
                    force of this sudden, intense strain. </p>

                    <p>Sometimes, the ACL is simply not strong enough to hold our leg bones together as they twist or pull away from each other under the force of our momentum, 
                    and so it frequently tears. Making matters much worse, we as a species are getting heavier, making our momentum even greater during those sudden shifts. This 
                    is especially true for athletes, who now weigh more than ever before, and who also make lots of sudden high-speed weight shifts.It is not just your imagination 
                    if you have noticed that ACL injuries have been getting steadily more common in the world of professional sports as the athletes get ever larger.</p>

                    <p>When the ACL is torn, it can only be repaired surgically. This is followed by a very long recovery and rehabilitation period because ligaments are not very 
                    vascular. This means there are few cells and blood vessels. It heals very slowly. This is why ACL tears are among the most feared injury in professional sports. 
                    It usually means a full season lost. The knee is an example of human anatomy that not perfectly adapted for our lifestyle, and the anterior cruciate ligament 
                    frequently tears as a result.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Why is this more common for female athletes?</h2>

                    <p>Female athletes put greater stress on their knees and particularly the ACL. Here are three factors have been identified:</p>

                            <p id="life">1. Females' knees are more "turned in" toward the middle of the body.</p>
                            <p id="life">2. Females' knees are less bent when jumping and landing.</p>
                            <p id="life">3. Females jump and run with the soles of the feet directed away</p> <p id="live" style="margin-top:-5%;">from the body's center of gravity.</p>

                    <p>Women may be more prone to non-contact ACL injuries because they run and cut sharply in a more erect posture than men, and bend their knees less when landing 
                    from a jump. Why women and girls are more prone to ACL injuries than men and boys defies easy explanation is also likely due to a number of anatomical and hormonal 
                    differences between men and women. Some differneces include a smaller ACL, a wider pelvis, more lax ligaments, slower reflex time, greater quadriceps to hamstring 
                    strength ratio, changes in estrogen levels and flat-footed landings.</p>

                    <p>Doctors continue to study the effect of soft and hard playing surfaces and the use of footwear such as cleats vs. sneakers to understand the higher rate of women 
                    with an ACL rupture. At this time no evidence-based information is available to strongly support that surfaces or footwear of a female have a role in the higher rate 
                    of injury.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Prevention</h2>

                    <p>A 2011 study found that two prevention programs, Sportsmetrics and PEP (Prevent Injury and Enhance Performance program) not only significantly reduced ACL injury
                    rates but improved athletic performance. Experts say there are four ways to reduce the risk of ACL injury:</p>
                                
                            <p id="life">1. Proper leg muscle strength and core training</p>
                            <p id="life">2. Proper balance and speed training</p>
                            <p id="life">3. Proper coaching on jumping and landing</p>
                            <p id="life">4. Proper footwear</p>

                    <p>A recent analysis of published ACL injury prevention programs determined that strengthening components were more important than balance training and that the 
                    favorable effects of training were most pronounced in female soccer players younger than 18 years. Another analysis found that various types of educational 
                    interventions appear to reduce the incidence rate of ACL injuries by approximately 50%.</p>
