                    <p>Surgery for ACL injuries involves reconstructing or repairing the ACL. ACL reconstruction surgery uses a graft to replace the ligament. 
                    The most common grafts are autografts using part of your own body, such as the tendon of the kneecap (patellar tendon) or one of the hamstring 
                    tendons. Sometimes the quadricep tendon from above the kneecap is used. Another choice is allograft tissue, which is taken from a deceased donor.
                    Repair surgery typically is used only in the case of an avulsion fracture (a separation of the ligament and a piece of the bone from the rest of 
                    the bone). In this case, the bone fragment connected to the ACL is reattached to the bone. ACL surgery is usually done by making small incisions 
                    in the knee and inserting instruments for surgery through these incisions (arthroscopic surgery). In some cases, it is done by cutting a large 
                    incision in the knee (open surgery).</p>

                    <p>There is a second surgery called Lysis of Adhesions. In occasional rare instances in which patients are unable to regain full extension,
                    you may be recommended for this surgery like I was. Arthrofibrosis of the knee is one of the most serious complications that can result from a
                    ligament surgery like an ACL reconstruction. Arthrofibrosis is the growth of scar tissue that prohibits motion in the joints. Reported incidences 
                    of arthrofibrosis following ACL reconstruction range from 4% to 35%. The loss 
                    of motion caused by arthrofibrosis can be even more disabling than the instability for which the reconstruction was performed, often requiring 
                    extensive physical therapy and/or surgical lysis of adhesions. With aggressive rehabilitation and modifications in the bracing of knees undergoing 
                    ligament reconstruction, the incidence of this complication has decreased significantly. Additionally, delaying ACL reconstruction until the acute 
                    inflammatory period has resolved has also been shown to be a significant factor in the reduction of postoperative knee stiffness.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Treatment Without Surgery</h2>

                    <p>A lot of people say you need ACL surgery if you want to return to sports. There are many studies that show you might be better off if you start
                    with rehabilitation. The injury that rips the ACL may damage other parts of the knee, particularly the meniscus (the piece of cartilage that cushions 
                    the bones of the knee). If you have a large meniscus tear and you fix the meniscus and not the ACL, there is a very high possibility the ACL will fail.
                    A patient who is a relatively low-level recreational athlete (Example: a 35-year-old cyclist) may be better off with bracing and rehabilitation. Only 
                    if such patients have further ACL problems would surgery be the preferred option. A college soccer player might not be able to return to play 
                    without an ACL reconstruction surgery. Studies do not answer the question of who specifically needs ACL surgery. They do not look into what factors
                    a patient has to have to need surgery to do well.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Rehabilitation</h2>

                    <p>Even though rehab is a part of both paths, it can be interpreted in different ways. My definition of rehab was a combination of visiting my physical
                    therapist, going to my school trainer, and creating an at home workout plan. My at home workout plan utilized my school weight room, exercises from my 
                    physical therapist and both stationary and regular bike riding. My surgeon prescribed the use of a CPM (Continuous Passive Motion) Machine. 
                    Over a course of about two weeks, I spent six hours of my day sitting on the sofa letting the machine move my leg for me to improve flexion after my 
                    second surgery.</p>
